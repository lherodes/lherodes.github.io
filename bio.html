		<h3>Logan Herodes' Bio:</h3>
		<p>My name is Logan Herodes and I am a Junior at Tufts University. I grew up in Falmouth, Maine and I have spent my life enjoying my family, technology and athletics. I have worked two internships, both of which were fantastic experiences in technology fields. I played football for two seasons at Tufts before deciding to switch to Club Water Polo and Quidditch to give myself more time for academics, side projects and life in general. I love computer science and have always had a strange knack for being able to guess what software is going to do before I even run it.
